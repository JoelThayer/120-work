This is my first text document for one of Dr. Musicks media arts courses.

1. Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.

I spent what felt like years trying to figure out the course website and figure out where everything is. When I eventually made that progress with help from Dr. Musick finally made enough progress that I could get this far and start typing and figuring this coding out.

2. What steps did you take to complete the assignment?

After we solved my issues of not being able to find the assignment, I went through the steps thouroughly after my meeting to make sure I didnt miss anything and then got to work making sure I had everything setup. Then I went through the steps individualy to finish the assignment.

3. Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?

I had all kinds of problems this week, but I felt that I was so far behind that I would go straight to Dr. Musick instead of the forum. The 1 one 1 really helped me get back settled in. 

4.Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?

I would like to just continue to get comfortable with the basics and continue from their.

5. What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?

I was pretty confused and wasnt much help to anyone this week.
